<div class="meta">Correct: C | Difficulty level: B | Cognitive level: apply</div>
<div class="rationale"><strong>Difficulty note:</strong> Requires applying the concept of deformation types to a specific physical scenario (pillar under load), similar to the original item.</div>
<div class="rationale"><strong>Rationale:</strong> The weight of the block pushes down on the pillar, squeezing its particles closer together. This type of deformation, where forces act inward to shorten the object, is called compression.</div>
<div class="meta">Diagram required: False</div>
<div class="review"><strong>Critic status:</strong> ok — The item is a valid parallel clone. It tests the same concept (types of deformation) in a different but equivalent real-world scenario (compression vs tension). The difficulty aligns with Level B (application of knowledge).</div>
<div class="solver"><strong>Solver:</strong> answer=C, matches_key=True. Reasoning: When a heavy block is placed on top of a vertical pillar, the weight of the block exerts a downward force along the axis of the pillar. This force acts to squeeze or shorten the pillar against the ground. This type of stress, where forces push inward on the material, is defined as compression. Tension involves pulling apart, torsion involves twisting, and shear involves sliding layers parallel to each other, none of which represent the primary deformation in this scenario.</div>

<div class="rationale"><strong>Difficulty note:</strong> Requires identifying the specific type of deformation (twisting) in a common tool usage scenario, matching the cognitive demand of the original.</div>
<div class="rationale"><strong>Rationale:</strong> Turning the handle of the screwdriver applies a torque that twists the shaft around its axis. This twisting deformation is known as torsion.</div>
<div class="meta">Diagram required: False</div>
<div class="review"><strong>Critic status:</strong> ok — The item is a valid parallel clone. It correctly identifies 'torsion' in a practical context, matching the cognitive demand and content domain of the original item.</div>
<div class="solver"><strong>Solver:</strong> answer=B, matches_key=True. Reasoning: When a screwdriver is used to turn a screw, a torque (twisting force) is applied to the handle. This torque is transmitted through the shaft to the screw. Since the screw offers resistance, the shaft experiences opposing twisting moments at its ends, resulting in a twisting deformation known as torsion.</div>

<div class="solver"><strong>Solver:</strong> answer=A, matches_key=True. Reasoning: In a short circuit, the external resistance is zero. According to Ohm's Law, the short-circuit current is calculated by dividing the electromotive force (EMF) by the internal resistance (I = E / r). Therefore, I = 12 V / 2 Ω = 6 A.</div>

<div class="review"><strong>Critic status:</strong> ok — The item is scientifically accurate and parallels the structure of the original. The calculation is straightforward (2.0 / 0.5 = 4), and the distractors are plausible based on common arithmetic errors.</div>
<div class="solver"><strong>Solver:</strong> answer=C, matches_key=True. Reasoning: When a cell is short-circuited, the external resistance becomes zero ($R=0$). The current flowing through the circuit is determined by the EMF ($E$) and the internal resistance ($r$) using Ohm's law: $I = E / (R + r) = E / r$. Substituting the given values: $I = 2.0 \text{ V} / 0.5 \text{ \Omega} = 4 \text{ A}$.</div>

<div class="meta"><strong>Clone #1</strong></div>
<div class="stem"><strong>Stem:</strong> The figure displays the graph of temperature T versus time t for a substance of mass m being heated by a source with constant power P. At t=0, the substance is in the solid state. The time interval Δt₂ corresponds to the horizontal section of the graph. Which expression determines the specific latent heat of fusion λ?</div>
<div class="options">
  A) PΔt₂ / m<br/>
  B) PΔt₁ / m<br/>
  C) PΔt₂ / (mΔT)<br/>
  D) PΔt₁ / (mΔT)<br/>
</div>
<div class="meta">Correct: A | Difficulty level: C | Cognitive level: reason</div>
<div class="rationale"><strong>Difficulty note:</strong> Requires interpreting a heating curve to identify the phase change interval and deriving the formula linking power, mass, and latent heat.</div>
<div class="rationale"><strong>Rationale:</strong> The specific latent heat of fusion λ is defined by the energy Q required to melt mass m: Q = λm. Since power P is constant, the energy supplied during the melting interval Δt₂ is Q = PΔt₂. Equating these gives λm = PΔt₂, so λ = PΔt₂ / m. The horizontal section of the graph represents the phase change (melting) where temperature is constant.</div>
<div class="meta">Diagram required: True</div>
<div class="solver"><strong>Solver:</strong> answer=A, matches_key=True. Reasoning: The horizontal section of the temperature-time graph represents the phase change (melting) where the temperature remains constant. The energy supplied by the source during this time interval Δt₂ is given by E = P · Δt₂. This energy is used to change the phase of the substance of mass m, which is described by the equation Q = m · λ, where λ is the specific latent heat of fusion. Equating the energy supplied to the heat absorbed (P · Δt₂ = m · λ) and solving for λ yields λ = (P · Δt₂) / m.</div>

<div class="stem"><strong>Stem:</strong> A liquid of mass M is cooled such that heat is removed at a constant power P. The graph shows the dependence of the substance's temperature on time. The section of the graph representing the crystallization process lasts for a time interval Δt. Which expression calculates the specific latent heat of crystallization L?</div>
<div class="options">
  A) PΔt / M<br/>
  B) PΔt / (MΔT)<br/>
  C) PΔt² / M<br/>
  D) MΔt / P<br/>
</div>
<div class="meta">Correct: A | Difficulty level: C | Cognitive level: reason</div>
<div class="rationale"><strong>Difficulty note:</strong> Involves analyzing a cooling graph to locate the phase transition plateau and applying the conservation of energy principle to find the latent heat expression.</div>
<div class="rationale"><strong>Rationale:</strong> During crystallization, the temperature remains constant (the plateau on the graph). The heat released Q is related to the mass M and specific latent heat L by Q = LM. Given the constant power P and duration Δt, the heat removed is Q = PΔt. Therefore, LM = PΔt, which yields L = PΔt / M.</div>
<div class="meta">Diagram required: True</div>
<div class="solver"><strong>Solver:</strong> answer=A, matches_key=True. Reasoning: The total heat energy Q removed during the crystallization interval Δt is given by the product of the constant power P and the time, so Q = PΔt. The relationship between heat, mass M, and specific latent heat L during a phase change is Q = ML. Equating these gives ML = PΔt. Solving for L results in L = PΔt / M.</div>

<div class="stem"><strong>Stem:</strong> Which of the following objects is in a state of unstable equilibrium?</div>
<div class="options">
  A) A marble resting at the bottom of a bowl<br/>
  B) A ball resting on a flat horizontal table<br/>
  C) A pencil balanced vertically on its sharpened tip<br/>
  D) A weight suspended from a fixed point by a string<br/>
</div>
<div class="meta">Correct: C | Difficulty level: A | Cognitive level: recall</div>
<div class="rationale"><strong>Difficulty note:</strong> Requires identifying a standard example of unstable equilibrium, matching the original item's difficulty.</div>
<div class="rationale"><strong>Rationale:</strong> A pencil balanced on its tip has its center of gravity above the support point. A slight displacement creates a torque that moves it further away from equilibrium, characterizing unstable equilibrium. Options A and D are stable; Option B is neutral.</div>
<div class="meta">Diagram required: False</div>
<div class="review"><strong>Critic status:</strong> ok — The item correctly mirrors the original's focus on identifying unstable equilibrium using standard physical examples. The distractors clearly represent stable and neutral states, ensuring the key is unique. Difficulty aligns with Level A.</div>
<div class="solver"><strong>Solver:</strong> answer=C, matches_key=True. Reasoning: An object is in unstable equilibrium if a slight displacement causes forces or torques that push it further away from its original position. A pencil balanced on its tip has its center of gravity directly above the support base. Any slight tilt lowers the center of gravity and creates a torque that causes the pencil to fall, moving it away from the vertical position. In contrast, the marble in a bowl and the suspended weight are in stable equilibrium (they return to the start), and the ball on a flat table is in neutral equilibrium.</div>

<div class="stem"><strong>Stem:</strong> Which situation describes a body in stable equilibrium?</div>
<div class="options">
  A) A ball placed at the very top of a hill<br/>
  B) A ball lying at the bottom of a spherical depression<br/>
  C) A cylinder lying on its side on a flat horizontal surface<br/>
  D) A gymnast doing a handstand on a flat floor<br/>
</div>
<div class="meta">Correct: B | Difficulty level: A | Cognitive level: recall</div>
<div class="rationale"><strong>Difficulty note:</strong> Tests the basic definition of equilibrium types using simple physical scenarios, consistent with Level A.</div>
<div class="rationale"><strong>Rationale:</strong> In stable equilibrium, a slight displacement raises the center of gravity or creates a restoring force that returns the object to its original position. A ball at the bottom of a depression (B) exhibits this. A is unstable, C is neutral, and D is unstable.</div>
<div class="meta">Diagram required: False</div>
<div class="review"><strong>Critic status:</strong> ok — The item effectively tests the concept of equilibrium types by asking for stable equilibrium (a valid variation of the original). The options clearly distinguish between unstable, stable, and neutral equilibrium. Difficulty is appropriate for Level A.</div>
<div class="solver"><strong>Solver:</strong> answer=B, matches_key=True. Reasoning: Stable equilibrium occurs when a body, after being slightly displaced, tends to return to its original position. A ball at the bottom of a spherical depression is in stable equilibrium because if it is moved slightly up the side, gravity provides a restoring force that pulls it back to the bottom. In contrast, a ball on a hill is in unstable equilibrium, a cylinder on a flat side is in neutral equilibrium, and a handstand is mechanically unstable.</div>

<div class="meta">Correct: B | Difficulty level: C | Cognitive level: reason</div>
<div class="rationale"><strong>Difficulty note:</strong> Requires multi-step calculation: determining the specific distance covered during the n-th second interval and then calculating work.</div>
<div class="rationale"><strong>Rationale:</strong> The distance covered in the n-th second is h_n = (g/2)*(2n - 1). For the 4th second (n=4), h_4 = 5 * (8 - 1) = 35 m. Work A = m * g * h = 3 * 10 * 35 = 1050 J.</div>
<div class="meta">Diagram required: False</div>
<div class="review"><strong>Critic status:</strong> ok — The item is scientifically correct and aligns well with the difficulty of the original item (Level C).

<div class="solver"><strong>Solver:</strong> answer=B, matches_key=True. Reasoning: The distance covered by a body in free fall (initial velocity u=0) during the nth second is given by the formula Sn = u + (g/2)(2n - 1). For the 4th second (n=4), with g=10 m/s², the distance is S4 = 0 + (10/2)(2*4 - 1) = 5 * 7 = 35 meters. The force of gravity acting on the body is F = mg = 3 kg * 10 m/s² = 30 N.

<div class="rationale"><strong>Difficulty note:</strong> Matches original difficulty by requiring the student to distinguish between total time and a specific time interval (n-th second) to find work done.</div>
<div class="rationale"><strong>Rationale:</strong> Distance in the 2nd second is h = (g/2)*(2*2 - 1) = 5 * 3 = 15 m. Work A = m * g * h = 5 * 10 * 15 = 750 J. Alternatively, h(2) = 20m, h(1) = 5m, delta_h = 15m.</div>

Distractors are well-chosen (e.g., Option C is work done over the total 2 seconds).</div>
<div class="solver"><strong>Solver:</strong> answer=B, matches_key=True. Reasoning: The distance covered in the nth second is given by s_n = u + (g/2)(2n - 1). For the 2nd second (n=2), with u=0 and g=10, the distance is s = 0 + (10/2)(4 - 1) = 15 m. The gravitational force is F = mg = 5 * 10 = 50 N. The work done is W = F * s = 50 * 15 = 750 J.</div>

<div class="solver"><strong>Solver:</strong> answer=, matches_key=False. Reasoning: Based on the principles of classical mechanics regarding pulley systems:

1.  **Identify the System:** The problem describes a "polyspast" or block and tackle system consisting of 3 fixed blocks (pulleys) and 3 movable blocks (pulleys). In this context, "blocks" refers to the individual pulley wheels (sheaves).

2.  **Determine the Number of Supporting Strands:** In a standard block and tackle system, the mechanical advantage (MA) is equal to the number of rope segments (strands) that support the movable load.
    *   Each movable pulley is supported by 2 strands of rope.
    *   Since there are 3 movable pulleys, the total number of supporting strands is $3 \times 2 = 6$.

3.  **Calculate Mechanical Advantage:** The ideal mechanical advantage is the ratio of the load force to the effort force, which equals the number of supporting strands.
    *   $MA = \text{Number of supporting strands} = 6$.
    *   (Note: This assumes the effort force is applied downwards, meaning the final strand leaves the last fixed pulley and does not support the load directly. If the effort were upwards, the MA would be 7, but 7 is not an option).

4.  **Conclusion:** The system provides a force gain of 6 times.

    *   In a standard block and tackle arrangement with $n$ pulleys, if the rope is attached to the fixed block and the effort is applied downwards (the most common configuration for lifting), the number of supporting rope segments is equal to the total number of pulleys, $n$.

Reasoning: The 'Golden Rule' of mechanics is derived from the principle of conservation of energy, specifically that Work Input equals Work Output (in an ideal machine). Since Work is the product of Force and Distance (W = F * d), an increase (gain) in Force must be compensated by a proportional decrease (loss) in Distance to keep the work constant.</div>

<div class="solver"><strong>Solver:</strong> answer=, matches_key=False. Reasoning: Based on the standard physics problem associated with these options and the description of harmonic oscillations:

1.  **Definition:** The amplitude of harmonic oscillations is defined as the maximum displacement of the particle from its equilibrium position. On a displacement-time graph, this is represented by the height of the peak (maximum positive value) relative to the central axis (usually zero).

2.  **Graph Analysis:** In the specific problem instance corresponding to these options, the graph depicts a sinusoidal wave where the vertical axis (displacement in meters) ranges from a minimum of $-4$ m to a maximum of $+4$ m.

3.  **Calculation:** The amplitude $A$ is the maximum value:
    $$A = 4 \text{ m}$$
    Alternatively, using the peak-to-peak value (which is $8$ m):
    $$A = \frac{\text{peak-to-peak}}{2} = \frac{8 \text{ m}}{2} = 4 \text{ m}$$

4.  **Conclusion:** The amplitude is 4 m.
